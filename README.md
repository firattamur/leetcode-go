This repository is my journey through learning Go by solving problems on LeetCode. It's not just about learning a new programming language but also about understanding how to maintain code quality and make use of various tools and practices like GitHub, Codecov, and Codacy to monitor and improve the quality of the code I write. 🚀

## Goals 🎯
- Learn Go syntax and concepts by solving practical problems. 📚

- Practice writing clean, efficient, and maintainable code. ✨

- Get hands-on experience with code quality tools and CI/CD practices. 🔧

- Learn how to use GitHub actions for automated testing and code quality checks. ⚙️

## Tools & Practices 🛠️
- Codacy: For automated code review to identify issues and improve code quality. 

- Codecov: For tracking the coverage of tests and ensuring that all parts of the code are properly tested. 

- GitHub Actions: For automating tests and lint checks on every push or pull request.
